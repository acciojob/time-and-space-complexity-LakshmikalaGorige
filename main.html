	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input efficient.</p>
	<p>The <b>space complexity</b> of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely O(n).</p>
